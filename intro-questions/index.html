        <h1>Selah's Introduction:</h1>
        
        <p>1.My name is Selah Pabon and I'm a senior majoring in Design with a concentration in
             Communications design and a minor in Computer Science!</p>

        <p>2.I would say my background consists of digital design and programming. This class is 
            a major requirement for me, but I am excited to take it, as it will bridge my two 
            areas of study and help strenghten my knowledge on HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

        <p>3.I was in a coding class in highschool where I learned a bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            This semester, on top of this class, I will be taking Visual Principles for the Screen and
            Web Development in which I will also be using HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

        <p>4.I hope to learn how to add fun animations to websites that will make them more interesting
            and engaging for users. I really value designs that are not only visually appealing but
            also prompt the user to interact with it in ways they wouldn't normally.</p>

        <p>5.One way that designing for screen would be different than for paper is you have to consider
            how the user will interact with the design. With paper, you only really have to consider
            how to draw the viewer in and cause a reaction, but with screen, you have to think about
            how the user will interact with the design and how it will respond to their actions/input.</p>

        <p>6.A website that I found that I feel exemplifies effective design is, https://foundry.basement.studio/fonts/grotesque.
            It is a website for a font foundry and I was drawn to its dark, alternative aesthetic. Each font 
            has its own page with a unique design that reflects the font's personality, and a letter in the designed font pops up 
            next to the side menu of font options.</p>
        
        <p>7.One website that I think exemplifies effective communication is, https://byhumankind.com.
            It's very easy to navigate and the product pages are very clear and informative. There are a lot of 
            photos and videos of the different products that make it clear what the user is shopping for/getting.</p>
        
        <p>8.A website that I think works well is, https://albumcolors.com. This site showcases 150 albums that released
            in 2020 in order to highlight the colors used in the album art. The albums are all organized in a grid by color, with
            the hexcode of the main color used written on each tile. There are a lot of cool features, with one of them being
            that if you click a button, the album art will fade away and you will only see the color that is being highlighted
            using the album. Additionally, when you refresh the page, the order in which the colors are organized changes, as does
            the main background color of the side. I think this website works well because it not only effectively communicates what it wants to,
            (the colors used in 2020 album art), but has an interesting and aesthetically pleasing design that is fun to interact with.</p>
