        <h5>Prep time: 10 mins | Cook time: 45 mins | Total time: 55 mins</h5>
        <h5>Serving size: 8  </h5>
        <h5>Equipment needed: Oven, baking dish, large bowl </h5>
        <h5>Temperature: Allow to cool slightly then serve </h5>
        <h5>Storage: You can store the baked apple crisp by covering it tightly with saran wrap and leaving it on the counter for up to three days. Refridgeration isn't necessary, but you can store it there. You can also freeze the dessert by allowing it to cool completely, covering it both in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, and storing it in the freezer for up to 4 months. Allow it to thaw overnight in the refridgerator before reheating.</h5>
